### Coffee Machine
The application contains yaml file with initial data.   

This Coffee Machine has 4 modes: buy, fill, take, remaining.    
In "buy" mode, the machine offers three coffees to choose: espresso, latte, cappuccino.
Each coffee requires a different amount of ingredients. If there are enough, coffee will be made.
If there are not enough, or there are not enough cups, the machine will report this.
It is also possible to return to the previous menu.     
In "feel" mode, the machine prompts you to add the necessary ingredients.       
In "take" mode, the machine will give you the accumulated money.        
In "remaining" mode, the machine will display a message on the screen about the number of ingredients, cups and accumulated money.      
If you enter anything else, the program will end.
